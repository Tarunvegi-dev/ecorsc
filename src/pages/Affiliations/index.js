          <h3>1. NFIR</h3>
          <p className='discrp'>
            History of the formation of INRWF (Indian National Railway Workers Federation) now NFIR In the annals of the Railway Labor Movement,
            May, 16, 1948 should be written in golden letters for on that date during Second Session of the INTUC being held at Bombay, the INTUC
            Working Committee decided that a very sizable number of railway employees having joined the INTUC, it had become imperative to form a
            Central Body to coordinate their activities and direct the movement on the right lines. The Indian National Railway Workers Federation
            (INRWF), thus, came into being. Late Shri Harihar Nath Shastri was elected the first President and Late Shri Govardhan ﻿Mapara became
            the General Secretary and Late Shri G. Ramanujam, the Treasurer. The INRWF caught the imagination of railwaymen. Major Unions soon joined
            its ranks. By the end of 1949, five actively functioning major Railway Unions, viz., the GIP National Railway Workers Union, the BB & CI
            Railway Employees Union, the E.P. Staff Railwaymen's Union, the O.T. Railwaymen's Union and the E. I. Railwaymen's Congress were recognized
            by the respective Administrations on fulfilling the requisite conditions. Again, out of the nine State Railways, the INRWF claimed fairly
            strong Unions in five. by that time, the Federation could gain an effective membership of 1, 50,000. Though a very large' section of
            organized Railwaymen joined the INRWF, the Railway Ministry did not recognize the Federation. But the workers' will at last prevail.
            lnspite of vile and vicious propaganda let loose by interested quarters like the CPI, AIRF and others and the bureaucratic antipathy
            and indifference, the Government was obliged to grant recognition to the INRWF in November, 1949. The then, INRWF is now known as NFIR
            since May, 1953.<br /><br />

          <h3>2. INTUC</h3>
          <p className='discrp'>
            The workers in India are only a section of the people and not a class apart. The culture and their tradition form part of the common heritage of the people of India. In organizing them and seeking the redressal of their grievances, ways and means have to be evolved in consonance with our condition. No more grafting or transplantation of a foreign ideology or method however suited to the condition else where, is likely to yield healthy results here. What is required is an indigenous movement having its roots in the Indian and soil. Such a movement has for long been in existence and has attained a remarkable center. A new organization, that would give the correct lead to the working class and strives to established social justice, peace and security with a constitution and working. Which would be essentially democratic giving every one of its constituent units ample scope for free expression of views and action has become imperative.”
            <br /><br />
            Thus declared the iron man and unifier of India. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, in his presidential address to unique congregation of national leader like Pandit Javaharlal Nehru, Jagjivan Ram, Aruna Asaf Ali, Ram Manohar Lohia,  G. Ramanujam, V.V. David, Shankar Rao Deo, B.G. Kher, O.P. Ramasami Reddiar, Ravi ShankarShukla, Hare Krishna Mehtab, S.K. Patil, Kamaldevi Chattopadhyaya, Ahoka Mehta, R.R. Diwakar and Bhimasen Sacar. Prominent among the labour leaders attending the conference were G.L. Nanda, Khadubhai Desai, Suresh Chandra Banerjee, Abid Ali Jaffarbhoy Michael John, Deven Sen, Harihar Nath Shashtri, S.R. Vasavda, S.P. Sen, R.K. Khedgikar, G.L. Mapara and G.D. Ambekar. They had all gathered at conference, held at the Constitution Club, New Delhi on May 3 and 4 ,1947 , determined to form a new trade union centre which could voice the genuine demands for realizing the aspirations of the working class in the country, at the same time keeping the national interest foremost in view. The number of trade unions centre which could voice the genuine demands for realization of the working class in the country, at the same time keeping the national interest foremost in view. The number of trade unions represented at the same conference was 200 with a total membership of over 5,65,000.
            <br /><br />
            Acharya J.B. Kripalani, the then president of the Indian National Congess who inaugurated the conference, in his address said: “ The proposed organization should not hesitate to employe the weapon of strike, if it were essential to promote the true interest of labour. But that weapon is to be employed only after due consideration and with aim was to achieve any legitimate economic and social objective. But it would however , not only be misuse of this weapon but doing actual harm to labour’s own interests if it were to be employes for the attainment of sectional political ends. If labour were to submit its organized strength to such exploitation. It would become a mere tool in the hands of unscrupulous party politicians.
            <br /><br />
            Blessing the new organization, the Acharya said: “It is a happy augury for the Indian working class that trained and trusted leaders of the labour movement are starting the new central organization on healthy lines.”
            <br /><br />
            Explaining the circumstances that led to the proposed organization, Shri Ghulzari Lal Nanda, Secretary of the Hindustan Mazdoor Sewak  Sangh under whose auspices the meeting was held, pointed out that to disclosed the productive organization of the nation at that crucial period in the history of the country was really to strike a direct blow on the life of the nation and its political integrity and it would harm which the communist activity was causing from day to day if to mischief was not counteracted at once.
            <br /><br />
            Concluding Shri Nanda said: “While there is no common ground  between those inspired by communist philosophy and those who have fail in democracy, the proposed organization can provide a broad platform and ensure the largest measure of unity as the latter in pursuit of the aim of the labour movement.”
            <br /><br />
            The main resolution moved by Dr. Suresh Chandra Banrjee said: “Whereas the course of the labour movement in the country is taking under the leadership of those who are opposed to peaceful change and democratic methods has provide extremely detrimental to the growth of strong and healthy trade unionism and is doing incalculable harm to the true interest of the masses of the country and whereas it has become a scared and imperative obligation of those who are for the well-being of the working class to take concerted action to safeguard and promote its interest, it is resolved that to give effect to this purpose, an organization – called the INDIAN NATIONAL TRDE UNION CONGRESS be formed.”
            <br /><br />
            The resolution was by late Michael John and was passed by an overwhelming majority.
            <br /><br />
            Thus INTUC was born on May 3, 1947 as historic necessity, just before Indian attained independence. The constitution of INTUC was adopted in the second day’s proceedings of the conference, Mahatma Gandhi who was then in Delhi also blessed the new found trade union centre.          </p>
